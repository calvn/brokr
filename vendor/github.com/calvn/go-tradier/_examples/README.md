# Examples

The `_examples/` directory provides minimal working examples on some of the methods provided in this library. Run any of these examples by simply placing a `.env` file within a particular subdirectory. The file needs to contain an assigned `TRADIER_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable.

For regular Tradier user accounts, the `TRADIER_ACCESS_TOKEN` can be requested from Tradier support. Keep this token safe and never commit it anywhere, as it is the key to your kingdom (or in this case, your brokerage account)!
