# TODO
Laundry list

## config
- [x] Initialize config file
- [ ] Merge existing config file
- [ ] Merge flag, env, and config file settings in priority

## commands
- [x] Subcommands should print help if no other values provided
- [ ] Version for more verbose info (e.g. go version, built time, os/arch)

## cli behavior
- [ ] Interactive/continuous command
- [ ] Better alternative to returning errors other that `fmt.Println()`
